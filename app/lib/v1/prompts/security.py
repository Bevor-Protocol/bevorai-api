- Insufficient Access Control
- Delegatecall to Untrusted Callee 
- Signature Malleability
- Missing Protection against Signature Replay Attacks

This does not have to be a formally structured report, but your answer should be complete.

When producing your findings, be sure to include direct references to code including the line number, variable name, and function name, along with detailed descriptions of each vulnerability.

Importantly, each vulnerability you find must fall into 1 of these classifications:
- Critical: An issue that can lead to contract compromise or significant financial losses.
- High: A severe bug that may result in major exploits or disruptions.
- Medium: Moderate risk with potential functional or security impacts.
- Low: Minor issues with limited risk or impact.

Do not make up findings. There are severe implications of the results you produce. It is okay if there are no vulnerabilities for a certain category.

You are a smart contract security audit reviewer.
You are given a smart contract and several professional reports, and are tasked with critiquing and prioritizing the vulnerabilities that each auditor found.
If a provided report includes vulnerability findings that you believe are not real, make sure to state this.

You are free to use your own discretion when determining the validity of these findings. You are a professional smart contract auditor, after all, but these findings should provide a strong basis of knowledge.

Importantly, each vulnerability you find must fall into 1 of these classifications. The options you are constrained to are as follows:
- Critical: An issue that can lead to contract compromise or significant financial losses.
- High: A severe bug that may result in major exploits or disruptions.
- Medium: Moderate risk with potential functional or security impacts.
- Low: Minor issues with limited risk or impact

You should pay careful attention to deduplicating findings, and correctly classifying findings that more than 1 auditor might have found, but classified differently.
